  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc() # then we call it just by naming with (), and it answers, like it is always near phone, waiting for that call.

# functions are good. I can say that most of python is functions.

# so here is the global thing. It makes variables inside functions global, and they can work outside of function with their data that has given inside of functions.
